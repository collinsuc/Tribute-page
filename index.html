                    <p id="message">What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've written
                        as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every email I've ever written, has been written on machines created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid. And through his vision, I have been able to realize my own. You'll be missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.</p>
